	<strong>Citi<sup>&reg;</sup> Hilton HHonors<sup>&trade;</sup> Reserve Card Additional Details</strong> </br>
	Hilton HHonors Bonus Points are earned on purchases except returned goods and services, cash advances, convenience checks, transferred balances, credits, fees and interest charges. Hilton HHonors Bonus Points will appear in your Hilton HHonors account within 4-6 weeks after you have met the purchase requirements and do not count toward elite tier qualification. Visit <a href="http://hhonors.com/terms" target="_blank">HHonors.com/Terms</a> for complete Terms and Conditions.
	</p>

					<p>To qualify for 10 HHonors Bonus Points per dollar spent, purchases including but not limited to charges at hotel restaurants, lounges, retail stores, or spas, must be charged to a cardmember’s hotel room bill and settled using the Citi Hilton HHonors Visa card upon checkout. Certain on-property vendors may not permit cardmember to charge to their hotel room, and such charges are not eligible to earn 10 HHonors Bonus Points per dollar spent.  Hotels are responsible for classifying transactions to enable Citi to recognize which ones qualify for 10 HHonors Bonus Points. If Citi receives a transaction without that information, Citi is unable to recognize that it qualifies. Citi reserves the right to determine which transactions qualify for 10 HHonors Bonus Points.</p>

	<p>Airlines are defined as transactions from airlines or air carriers. Car Rentals are defined as transactions involving the short-term or long-term rentals of cars, trucks, or vans. We do not determine whether merchants appropriately identify transactions, but we do reserve the right to determine which purchases qualify for the 5 HHonors Bonus Points per dollar spent on these categories.</p>

	<p>HHonors Gold status is complimentary as long as you are a Citi Hilton HHonors Reserve cardmember. If in any calendar year (January through December billing statements) your total spend on your Citi Hilton HHonors Reserve card reaches US$40,000 in purchases (posted to your January through December billing statements), you will be upgraded to Hilton HHonors Diamond status. You will retain Diamond status for the calendar year in which it was earned through the end of the following calendar year. Thereafter, in order to maintain Diamond status, you must meet the annual qualifying purchase requirement with your Citi Hilton HHonors Reserve card or meet the standard requirements outlined in the Hilton HHonors Program. Allow 4-6 weeks from completion of purchase requirements for your status to be upgraded. For more information on Gold or Diamond status and complete Terms and Conditions, visit <a href="http://hhonors.com/terms" target="_blank">HHonors.com/Terms</a>.</p>

	<p>To receive the weekend night certificate, you must spend $10,000 on purchases within a year (starting from your Annual Fee Date) and your account needs to remain open for at least one billing period after your Annual Fee Date.  Your Annual Fee Date is the date that your card account is billed for your annual fee and resets each year on that date.  Please allow 6 to 8 weeks to receive your certificate via email.  If you do not have an email registered with HHonors, you must call 1-800-HHonors to receive and redeem your certificate.</p>

		<p>HHonors points will not expire provided that the Hilton HHonors member takes one of the following actions within a 12 consecutive month period (1) stay at a hotel within the Hilton Portfolio, (2) earn HHonors points through any participating partner, (3) purchase HHonors points, or (4) donate points through The Hilton HHonors Giving Back Program.
